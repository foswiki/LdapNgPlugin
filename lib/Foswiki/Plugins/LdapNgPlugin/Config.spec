# This is a map of LDAP attributes to be added to the solr document when the current is a user profile page. These attributes are
# added to the profile page as if they where formfield values of the given name. Each entry in this map has got the format
# <pre>attributeName => 'fieldName'</pre>
# where <code>fieldName</code> is a valid formfield name and <code>attributeName</code> is an LDAP attribute name to be fetched from the LDAP directory.
# In those cases where an formfield of the same name as the LDAP attribute is found, the formfield value takes higher precedence.
# Note that you might map multiple LDAP attributes onto the same field name. This will help in those cases where user records might follow different
# conventions across all of your LDAP directory.
